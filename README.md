# local-library-express

To run the project locally, download the files. 

$ cd local-library-express
$ npm init

This will install all project dependency locally on your machine.  

To start the local server, you can either start the regular server included in Express: 
$ npm start

Or you can use nodemon (already configured) to avoid restarting the server every time a change is made (you still have to reload the page, there is not hot reloading): 
$ npm run serverstart
